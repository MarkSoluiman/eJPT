# Lab Environment

In this lab environment, you will have access to a target machine available at **http://target.ine.local**. Additionally, a Nessus dashboard is set up for vulnerability scanning and can be accessed via **https://localhost:8834/**. Use the provided credentials to log into the Nessus dashboard for further analysis.

**Credentials:**

```
Username: admin
Password: adminpasswd
```

**Objective:** Identify the services running on the machine, perform a detailed vulnerability scan, and capture all the flags hidden within the environment.

**Flags to Capture:**

- **Flag 1**: Explore hidden directories for version control artifacts that might reveal valuable information.
- **Flag 2**: The data storage has some loose security measures. Can you find the flag hidden within it?
- **Flag 3**: A PHP file that displays server information might be worth examining. What could be hidden in plain sight?
- **Flag 4**: Sensitive directories might hold critical information. Search through carefully for hidden gems.

We will start with our Nmap scan and we export our scan results to .xml file: `nmap -Pn -sS -A -v (target) -oX (file_name.xml)`

We found multiple ports open with services: http:80, mysql:3306

We will start Postgresql and MSF and import the file that we got from Nmap

In fact, the Nmap scan showed us the robots.txt file and we have these directories:
Disallow: passwords/
Disallow: config.inc
Disallow: classes/
Disallow: javascript/
Disallow: owasp-esapi-php/
Disallow: documentation/
Disallow: phpmyadmin/
Disallow: includes/

Now, if we went to the passwords/ directory, we will find the forth flag along with a text file that looks like it has some credentials.

We notice something else from our Nmap scan. The website has a /.git directory.

To get the first flag, we will go to the /.git directory that we found

We will find the first flag in text file called "flag.txt"

**First flag: 03f7734a03574b068a0268dcc3fc1f1c**

The second flag would be found in the /phpmyadmin directory which will lead us to mysql phpmyadmin page. The flag can be found in mysql database under secret_info table

**Second flag: f99eeefc22234f6e856f497b2a055834**

---

To find the third flag, we will need to run nmap scan again but with a specific script. We will run the http-enum.nse script: `nmap -Pn -sS -v --script=http-enum.nse (target)`. This will reveal the /php.info.php page which contains the third flag.

**Third flag: f80330a9e46142bca7583cf39f84b80b**

---

The forth flag can be found in the /passwords directory in the flag.txt file.

**Forth flag: 8e83a069e5664fe687303ca5194ffe6e**
