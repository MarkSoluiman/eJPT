## Vulnerability Analysis: EternalBlue (MS17-010/CVE-2017-0144)

EternalBlue is the name given to a collection of Windows vulnerabilities and exploits that allow attackers to remotely execute malicious code and gain access to a Windows system and thus to gain access to the same network the device is connected to.

The Eternal Blue exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Windows SMBv1 protocol that allows attackers to send specially crafted packets that consequently facilitate the execution of arbitrary commands.

The exploit has a MSF auxiliary module that can be used to check if a target system is vulnerable to the exploit and it also has an exploit module to execute the exploit itself.

A tool that we can use to exploit this vulnerability other than the one in MSF is :AutoBlue: https://github.com/3ndG4me/AutoBlue-MS17-010

**There is a script in Nmap that can scan the target if it is vulnerable to the EternalBlue vuln or not:  "smb-vuln-ms17-010"**

## BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708 RDP Vuln)

BlueKeep is the given name to an RDP vuln in Windows that could potentially allow attackers to remotely execute malicious code and gain access to a Windows system and thus have access to the network.

The BlueKeep exploit has an MSF module that can be used to check if the system is vulnerable to the exploit and also has an exploit module that can be used to perform the exploit.

**The auxiliary module name: auxiliary/scanner/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep**

**The exploit module name: exploit/windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep**

**The exploit module only works on 64 bits Windows**
