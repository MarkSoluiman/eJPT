## Web App Vulnerability Scanning with WMAP

WMAP is a MSF plugin.

After installing it to MSF, we start by: `load wmap` in MSF.

We need to add the target site to the lists of sites before adding it as a target: `wmap_sites -a (target site)`

We can add our site target by:`wmap_targets -t (site IP)`

To list every module that WMAP would run agaisnt hte target: `wmap_modules -l`

These modules are categorized into categories. For example, the modules:  "auxiliary/scanner/http/brute_dirs" and "auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner" are both under the wmap_dir category.

To launch every module: `wmap_run -e`.
