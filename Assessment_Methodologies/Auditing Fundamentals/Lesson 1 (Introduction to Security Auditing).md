## Types of Security Audits



| Type of Audit      | Objective                                                                                       | Importance                                                                 | Example                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Internal Audits    | Conducted by the organization's internal audit team or security professionals to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and compliance with policies. | Internal audits provide insight into the organization’s self-assessment of its security posture and highlight areas that may require more in-depth testing. | An internal audit might review user access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data. |
| External Audits    | Performed by independent third-party auditors to provide an unbiased evaluation of the organization’s security measures and compliance with external standards. | External audits often serve as benchmarks for compliance and security effectiveness. Penetration testers can use these findings to guide their testing efforts. | A company undergoing a PCI DSS compliance audit might hire an external auditor to validate its security controls and ensure they meet the required standards. |
| Compliance Audits  | Focus on verifying that the organization complies with specific regulatory requirements and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS). | Compliance audits help identify regulatory gaps that penetration testers can address through targeted testing. | A healthcare provider might undergo a HIPAA compliance audit to ensure that patient data is protected according to federal regulations. |
| Technical Audits   | Focus on assessing the technical aspects of the organization’s IT infrastructure, including hardware, software, and network configurations. | Technical audits provide a detailed view of the technical controls in place, highlighting areas where penetration testing can uncover vulnerabilities. | A technical audit might involve a thorough review of firewall configurations to ensure they are properly securing the network perimeter. |
| Network Audits     | Assess the security of the organization’s network infrastructure, including routers, switches, firewalls, and other network devices. | Network audits can reveal vulnerabilities in network design and configurations that penetration testers can exploit to assess network security. | A network audit might identify insecure protocols being used for data transmission, prompting penetration testers to test for potential exploits. |
| Application Audits | Evaluate the security of software applications, focusing on code quality, input validation, authentication mechanisms, and data handling. | Application audits highlight security flaws in applications that penetration testers can exploit to demonstrate real-world attack scenarios. | An application audit might reveal vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) in a web application. |

Offers recommendations for mitigating identified risks and improving security defenses.                |
| **Frequency**   | Often performed on a regular basis (e.g., annually or biannually) or as required by compliance regulations.                                                                                         | Typically performed as needed, such as after significant changes to systems, on a regular schedule, or as part of compliance requirements.                                             |


### Sequential Approach:

**Perform Security Audit First:** Companies often conduct a security audit first to evaluate their overall security posture, ensure compliance with regulations, and identify areas for improvement in policies and procedures. 
**Conduct Pen-testing Afterwards**: Based on the findings of the audit, a pen-test may be performed to assess the effectiveness of technical controls and identify specific vulnerabilities.

**Advantages**:
- Provides a comprehensive view of security from both policy and technical perspectives.
- Identifies and addresses gaps in both procedural and technical controls.
- Helps prioritize remediation efforts based on audit findings.

### Combined Approach 

**Integrate Security Audit and Pen-testing:** Some organizations choose to combine security audits and pen-testing, often through a holistic security assessment that incorporates both elements.

**Advantages:**
- Streamlines the assessment process by combining policy, procedural, and technical evaluation.
- Provides a more complete picture of the organization's security posture in a single engagement.
- Can be more efficient and cost-effective by addressing both compliance and technical vulnerabilities simultaneously.

### Example: Sequential Approach 

Consider a fictional organization, "SecurePayments Inc.," which processes credit card transactions and must adhere to PCI DSS standards.
In this example, “SecurePayments Inc.” is using a sequential approach to assess their overall security posture. The organization has already performed a security audit through an independent audit firm and are using the findings in the audit report as the basis of their remediation plan/efforts. 
As part of their remediation plan, the organization has decided to hire you (or your firm) to perform a penetration test with a focus on ensuring PCI DSS compliance.

The external audit performed by the independent audit firm outlined the following findings:

- Inadequate encryption for cardholder data in transit.
- Weak/inadequate network security controls and traffic monitoring.
- Weak access control policies that allow excessive permissions.
- Outdated incident response procedures.

The corresponding recommendations for the findings outlined above are:

- Implement strong encryption protocols for data in transit.
- Revise access control policies to follow the principle of least privilege.
- Update and test incident response procedures regularly.

**Objectives**: After making the necessary changes/improvements based on the findings and recommendations in the external audit report, "SecurePayments Inc." has hired you to: Test the technical controls and security measures implemented based on audit findings to verify whether they are effective.

**<u>Phase 1: Planning and Preparation</u>**

During the initial phase, you identify that the PCI DSS scope includes the cardholder data environment (CDE). You review SecurePayments Inc.’s network diagrams and PCI DSS self-assessment questionnaires to understand their current security measures and compliance status.

**Objectives:**
- Define the scope of the penetration test to focus on the areas identified in the audit, such as network security and application vulnerabilities.
- Set up a testing schedule and inform stakeholders.

**<u>Phase 2: Information Gathering and Reconnaissance:</u>**
- You gather information on SecurePayments Inc.'s security policies, such as their access control policies, encryption standards, and incident response procedures.
- You also review their most recent PCI DSS audit report to identify areas of concern highlighted by auditors.

**<u>Phase 3: Penetration Test Execution</u>:**
- Conduct network scanning, enumeration and vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses, misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
- Attempt exploitation of identified vulnerabilities to assess their impact.
- Test the effectiveness of newly implemented encryption and access controls.

**<u>Phase 4: Findings and Recommendations:</u>**
**Outcome:** The penetration test uncovers additional vulnerabilities:
- An exposed administrative interface that allows unauthorized access.
- SQL injection vulnerabilities in a customer-facing web application.
**Recommendations**:
- Secure the administrative interface by implementing additional authentication and access controls.
- Patch the SQL injection vulnerabilities and conduct a thorough review of application security.
