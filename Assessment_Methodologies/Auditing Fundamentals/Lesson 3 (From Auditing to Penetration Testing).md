## Phase 1 - Develop a Security Policy

<u>Background</u>:

**Company:** SecureTech Solutions

<u>Description:</u>

SecureTech Solutions is a fictitious cybersecurity consultancy that specializes in
securing IT infrastructure for various clients.
 In this example, we will be demonstrating the process of developing a security policy for Linux servers, performing a risk assessment using the NIST SP 800-53 framework, performing a security audit and testing the remediations.
This example will guide us through the entire process, from initial policy creation to auditing and penetration testing, highlighting the importance of compliance with industry standards.

<u>Objectives:</u>

Establish a baseline security policy for Linux servers that aligns with NIST SP 800-53 guidelines, ensuring that servers are configured and managed securely.
This policy should ensure that Linux servers are secure and protected from unauthorized access, vulnerabilities, and other security threats.
It will be used to establish baseline security requirements for configuring, maintaining, and monitoring Linux servers within the organization, aligned with NIST SP 800-53.

<u>Security Policy Development Process: Requirements Gathering</u>

**Purpose:** Define the purpose and scope of the security policy.
**Access Control:** Outline user account management, authentication methods, and privilege management.
**Audit and Accountability:** Specify logging requirements and log review procedures.
**Configuration Management:** Define baseline configurations, software update practices, and change management.
**Identification and Authentication:** Enforce strong password policies and unique user identification.

**System and Information Integrity:** Implement malware protection, security monitoring, and vulnerability management.
**Maintenance:** Outline controlled maintenance and approved maintenance tools.

<u>Simple Security Policy for Linux Servers Aligned with NIST SP 800-53</u>


| Policy Area                              | Control ID        | Policy Statement |
|------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Access Control (AC)**                  | AC-2, AC-5       | **User Accounts:** Only authorized personnel shall be granted access to Linux servers.<br>Each user must have a unique user account; shared accounts are prohibited.<br>Inactive accounts must be disabled or removed within 30 days. |
|                                          | IA-2, IA-5       | **Authentication:** Enforce strong password policies: minimum length of 12 characters, including upper/lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.<br>Use SSH key-based authentication where possible; disable password-based SSH access.<br>Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for privileged accounts. |
| **Audit and Accountability (AU)**         | AU-2, AU-3       | **System Logging:** Enable and configure system logging to capture critical events.<br>Use rsyslog or journald for centralized logging. |
|                                          | AU-6, AU-7       | **Log Review:** Regularly review logs for suspicious activities.<br>Retain logs for at least 90 days. |
| **Configuration Management (CM)**         | CM-2             | **Configuration Baseline:** Maintain a secure baseline configuration for all Linux servers.<br>Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet) to enforce configurations. |
|                                          | CM-3, CM-5       | **Software Updates:** Keep the system and installed software up to date.<br>Apply security patches within 30 days of release. |
| **Identification and Authentication (IA)** | IA-5             | **Password Management:** Enforce password complexity and expiration policies.<br>Use password managers to securely store and manage passwords. |
|                                          | IA-4             | **User Identification:** Ensure all users are uniquely identified. |
| **System and Information Integrity (SI)** | SI-3             | **Malware Protection:** Implement malware detection and prevention measures.<br>Regularly scan servers for malware. |
|                                          | SI-4             | **Security Monitoring:** Monitor systems for security breaches or anomalies.<br>Use tools like Lynis to perform regular security audits. |
| **Maintenance (MA)**                      | MA-2             | **Controlled Maintenance:** Perform regular maintenance on servers according to documented procedures. |
|                                          | MA-3             | **Maintenance Tools:** Use only approved maintenance tools and ensure they are secure. |

## Phase 2 - Security Auditing with Lynis


<u>Objective:</u> Perform a security audit on a Linux server using Lynis, identify
vulnerabilities, and remediate the findings based on the security policy.

<u>1. Installing and Running Lynis:</u>
**Install Lynis:** Install Lynis on the Linux server.
**Audit the Server:** Run a Lynis audit scan on the target Linux server.
**Review the Report:** Analyze the Lynis report to identify security issues
and recommendations.

<u>2. Remediation:</u>
Address Findings: Remediate vulnerabilities identified in the Lynis report (e.g., updating software, enforcing password policies).
Update Security Policy: Document remediation actions and update the security policy to reflect changes.

## Phase 3 - Conduct Penetration Test

<u>Objective</u>: To validate the effectiveness of remediation actions through a
penetration test, ensuring that the Linux server is secure and compliant with
the security policy.

<u>1. Execution:</u>
- **Network Scan**: Use Nmap to identify open ports and services. 
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use Metasploit to find and exploit vulnerabilities. 
- **Web Application Testing:** Use Burp Suite to test web applications (if applicable).

<u>2. Validating Remediation:</u>
- **Compare Results**: Compare initial audit findings with penetration test results to verify that vulnerabilities have been addressed. 
- **Check for New Vulnerabilities**: Identify and remediate any new vulnerabilities introduced during the remediation phase.

<u>3.Reporting</u>:  
- **Executive Summary**: Provide an overview of the penetration test and major findings.  
- **Methodology**: Detail the tools and techniques used during the test. 
- **Findings:** Describe vulnerabilities found, including severity and potential impact. 
- **Recommendations:** Offer steps to further secure the system
