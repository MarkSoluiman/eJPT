## What is Information Gathering?

The first step of pen-testing is to gather information about the target. The more information we will gather at the this stage, the more successful we will be at pen-testing our target.

There are two types of info gathering:

1. ==Passive 
2. ==Active

Passive is about gathering info about the target without interacting with it. Active is to gather as much info as possible about the target by directly interacting with it. For example, **port scanning is active info gathering.**
