We can list files and directories which are writable by anyone: 
`find / -not -type l -perm -o+w`
If we found the shadow file that contains the users with their passwords, we can modify the file to set a password for user root.

First we need to generate a SHA-512 hash of a password we choose, on our local machine: `openssl passwd -6 (new password)`

We copy the output.

Then, we modify the shadow file using a text editor like vim. Next to root user, we will put the output that we got between the two colons like so :output here:

After saving the file, we can attempt to login to root user like so: `su - root`

After providing the password we specified, we will be signed in as root.


Another way to escalate our privileges is that we list binary files that we don't require to provide a password to run them. We can list these files by: `sudo -l`

For example, if we found that we can run the tool man without a password, we can get root privileges using man tool.

First we run man like so: `sudo man cat`. This will give us the manual page for "cat" tool. Within the manual page, we will type: `!/bin/bash`. This will give us root privileges.
