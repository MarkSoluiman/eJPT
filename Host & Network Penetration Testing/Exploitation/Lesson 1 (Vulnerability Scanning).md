## Banner Grabbing

There is an Nmap script that can grab banners from multiple services: **"banner.nse"**

We can also use Netcat to grab banners from services. For example, to grab ssh banner: `nc (target IP) 22`

## Searching For Exploits With SearchSploit

We can copy an exploit file using searchsploit like so: `searchsploit -m (exploit id)` this will copy the exploit file to the current working directory. 

We can search for keywords to appear in the exploit title: `searchsploit -t (keyword)`

We can use the flag **(-e)** to search for exact key words.

We can search for exploit that meet specific categories. For example, if we want to search for exploits that target Windows SMB and the exploit is remotely executed, we can do: `searchsploit remote windows smb`

We can use the flag **(-w)** that would show us the URL of the exploit.
